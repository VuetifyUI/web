## Reporting a Bug

Vuetify UI take security bugs **VERY SERIOUSLY**. That is the only reason we rely on most recent release of Primary Libraries i.e. Vuetify.js and Vue.js and related libraries.

Although, Vuetify UI is mere a UI Snippet Library which have a very minimal risk of being under any security risk, Even though I take all security bugs in Vuetify UI seriously. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [vuetify-ui@nitroxis.com](mailto:vuetify-ui@nitroxis.com?subject=SECURITY) and include the word **"SECURITY"** in the subject line.

After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and you may be asked for additional information about reported issue.

Report security bugs in third-party modules such as [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues) or [Vuetify.js](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues) to their github repo. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
